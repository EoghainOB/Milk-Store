# Milk E-Way Milk Store

This was a fun project to work on. I created a 'Milk Store', which contains 99 different types of Milk for sale. The site is made with Typescript on the front and backend and uses Express to interact with the MongoDB, which contains the products. The site integrates pagination as well as filtering and search and each product has its own page with dedicated URL. The user can select the quantity of milk using the slider and it can be added to the cart. The cart is very basic and is my first time creating one and it features the ability to update the cart by deleting the items. More features to come.

## Instructions
If you wish to try this on your own computer, simply clone this repository to your own machine. You will need to then run NPM install from the route directory. Once installed you should run 'npm start' in your terminal from both the root folder, for the front end, and again in the /backend/ folder for the backend.

<i>*I have included the .e n v file for MongoDB, which is know is not good practice.</i>
